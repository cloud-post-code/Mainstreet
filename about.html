      <h1 class="about-mission-title">Our Mission</h1>
      <p class="about-mission-statement">Local businesses are the heartbeat of every community. The corner gift shop that knows your name. The artisan who makes everything by hand. The boutique that only carries things the owner truly loves. These places matter — not just economically, but culturally. They are who we are.</p>
      <p class="about-mission-statement">Main St. exists to make sure they are never invisible.</p>
      <p class="about-mission-statement">We build tools, technology, and community infrastructure that help local shops get online, get discovered, and grow — on their own terms, at their own pace, with their own identity intact. We believe every local business deserves a digital presence as beautiful and meaningful as the shop itself. And we believe the communities that surround them deserve an easier way to find them, support them, and keep coming back.</p>
      <p class="about-mission-statement">That is our mission. Simple, and worth everything.</p>

        Our Vision
      </h2>
      <p class="about-text">We are living through a remarkable and disorienting moment. Artificial intelligence is reshaping how the world works — how things are made, how they are sold, how they are found. For large corporations, AI is a weapon. For local businesses, it has too often felt like a threat.</p>
      <p class="about-text">We see it differently.</p>
      <p class="about-text">AI, deployed simply and appropriately, can be one of the most powerful tools a small business has ever had. It can write a product listing in seconds. It can help a first-time seller look like a seasoned professional. It can surface the right shop to the right customer at exactly the right moment. The question was never whether AI belongs on Main Street. The question was whether anyone would build it for Main Street.</p>
      <p class="about-text">We are.</p>
      <p class="about-text">But technology is only half of what we believe in. The other half is irreplaceable, and no algorithm will ever replicate it: the warmth of a community that chooses to shop local. The customer who drives a little further because they trust the person behind the counter. The artisan who puts their name on everything they make. The shop owner who knows which candle you bought last Christmas.</p>

    <section class="about-section about-how">
      <h2 class="about-section-title">
        <span class="about-title-icon material-icons">help_outline</span>
        How It Works
      </h2>
      <p class="about-text">Main St. is built to protect that. To amplify it. To give it a home online that feels as real as the street it came from.</p>
      <p class="about-text">What we build rests on three pillars:</p>
      <ul class="about-pillars">
        <li class="about-pillar">
          <strong>The Main St. Index</strong> — A living, searchable directory of local shops across every community we serve. Not a generic business listing. A real record of who is out there, what they carry, and what makes them worth visiting. If you want to shop local but don't know where to start, the Index is where you begin. Every shop deserves to be findable. We are building the place that makes that possible.
        </li>
        <li class="about-pillar">
          <strong>Web Tools for Local Shops</strong> — Purpose-built software for the shop owner who has never had software built for them. A storefront that goes live in 48 hours. AI-assisted product listings. Connected artisan networks. Inventory management, fulfillment support, and a sales dashboard that actually makes sense. Everything a local business needs to sell online — and nothing they don't.
        </li>
        <li class="about-pillar">
          <strong>Building Local Relationships</strong> — Technology connects people, but relationships keep communities alive. Main St. is designed to deepen the bonds between shop owners and their artisans, between sellers and their customers, and between local businesses and the neighborhoods they serve. We are not just building a platform. We are building the infrastructure for local commerce to thrive — together.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- History -->
    <section class="about-section about-history">
      <h2 class="about-section-title">
        <span class="about-title-icon material-icons">history</span>
        Our History
      </h2>
      <p class="about-text">Main St. started with a simple and stubborn belief: local shops should not have to fight this hard just to exist online.</p>
      <p class="about-text">We watched incredible businesses — shops with loyal followings, incredible products, and deep community roots — struggle to be found by anyone beyond their immediate neighborhood. The tools that existed were built for solo merchants or global brands. Nothing was built for the shop owner who also manages three artisans, runs a weekend market, and answers customer emails at midnight.</p>
      <p class="about-text">So we built it ourselves.</p>
      <p class="about-text">One of the first things we knew we needed to create was an index — a comprehensive, searchable directory of local shops, what they sell, and what makes them special. Not a generic business listing. A living record of the local economy, built to help customers discover the businesses that deserve their attention and help those businesses understand their own place in the community ecosystem.</p>
      <p class="about-text">That index became the foundation of everything Main St. is today. It grew into storefronts. Then into connected artisan networks. Then into proprietary software that links a local shop directly to every maker they work with — shared inventory, shared customers, shared community.</p>
      <p class="about-text">We are not a marketplace that happened to add local shops. We are a local shop platform that built a marketplace around them. The order of those words matters.</p>

    <!-- A Note From Blake -->

        A Note From Blake
      </h2>
      <blockquote class="about-note-quote">
        <p>My mother ran a poetry magazine.</p>
        <p>It was a print publication — the kind that took real work to make and real love to sustain. She used it to get local poets published and recognized, to give voices that might otherwise go unheard a place to land on a real page. I was a kid watching her do it, and I didn't fully understand what she was building at the time. I just knew it mattered to people. I knew the poets who were published in it stood a little taller. I knew the community around it was real.</p>
        <p>That stayed with me.</p>
        <p>When I started Main St., I wasn't consciously thinking about my mother's magazine. But somewhere in the belief that local voices deserve a platform — that the people making beautiful things in their communities deserve more than an algorithm's indifference — I was absolutely thinking about it.</p>
        <p>Every shop on Main St. is someone's life's work. Every artisan is someone's creative identity. Every community marketplace we build is a small act of insisting that local still matters, that handmade still matters, that the person behind the product is worth knowing.</p>
        <p>My mom taught me that. I'm still trying to live up to it.</p>

          <p class="about-team-role">Co-Founder & CEO</p>
          <p class="about-team-bio">Blake has spent his career at the intersection of community, technology, and local commerce. He is the driving force behind Main St.'s mission and platform, leading product development, community partnerships, and the vision for how local businesses can use technology without losing what makes them human. Before Main St., Blake built and operated 4GoodVibes, a handmade marketplace in the Boston area that became the proving ground for everything Main St. is today — growing from zero to over 146 active shops, 8,419 products, and $37,252 in sales without spending a dollar on advertising. Blake is a builder, a community organizer, and the son of a woman who believed that giving local voices a platform was always worth the effort.</p>

          <h3 class="about-team-name">Arjun Singh</h3>
          <p class="about-team-role">Co-Founder</p>
          <p class="about-team-bio">Arjun brings the technical depth and operational rigor that turns a great idea into a platform that actually works. He and Blake share a belief that the tools being built for big business can and should be rebuilt for the businesses that need them most — the ones on the corner, the ones at the market, the ones that close if the community stops showing up. Arjun's work ensures that Main St. is not just a beautiful vision but a reliable, scalable, and genuinely useful product for every shop that trusts us with their business.</p>
